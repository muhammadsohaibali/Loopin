  Loopin is a social media web app focused on connecting users through real-time messaging, friend feeds, and content sharing. 
  The goal is to create a modern, intuitive, Gen Z-friendly user interface using only front-end technologies, while all backend 
  logic and server-side functionality is handled separately.

tech_stack:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Vanilla JavaScript (No Frameworks)

theme:
  primary: "#4361ee"        # vibrant blue
  secondary: "#3f37c9"      # deep blue
  accent: "#4cc9f0"         # light blue
  background: "#f8f9fa"     # light gray
  text: "#212529"           # dark gray
  white: "#ffffff"
  error: "#ef233c"
  success: "#4bb543"

design_guidelines:
  - Clean, modern UI/UX
  - Gen Z-friendly look and feel
  - Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
  - Semantic HTML5 structure
  - Modular CSS (if possible)
  - Use of white space, subtle shadows, and sharp typography
  - No backend logic (API, database) in frontend code

pages:
  - Login Page
  - Register Page
  - Forgot Password Page
  - Homepage (Feed)
  - Chats Page (1-on-1 messaging)
  - Find Users Page (search + send requests)
  - Profile Page (Current user or any other user)
  - MORE WILL BE ADDED TIME TO TIME AS REQUIRED

notes: >
  Frontend only. All server-side, backend APIs, database handling, auth logic, etc., will be added separately. 
  Frontend JS can include basic interactivity like form validation, image previews, toggles, etc.
